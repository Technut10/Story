It was the best of times
it was the worst of times
don't forget me when I'm gone
Lean on me, when you're not strong
Thank you for purchasing this album yeah?

As we forget about what is needed with time, we will remember who we are!
And we shall never be. And nevermore.... 
Lest we forget the time we used to be human? Have we forgotten how?
