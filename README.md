My masterpiece

This is all just for practice

As I have started my computer science journey, (back in college! Whoo!) I am excited to share my experience and projects that I can create. I am a down to earth dude who 

loves to code and program. Not sure just yet where I am going to end up, but I know I am going to love it!

I am looking to create more autonomus development, AI, deep learning, game development, and data analytics. 

I have experience with web app coding, python, and some 2d video game creation. I am hoping to collab with anyone who has the same interest as I do. I am not sure just 

yet but I am learning more about Nvidia and their departments. 

We shall see how the next few years go eh? I game, play guitar, and watch a lot of movies. 

Take good care everyone!
